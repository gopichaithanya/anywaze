**Anywaze** is a project I created while at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com), while participating in the [Data Engineering](http://insightdataengineering.com) track of the program.  It's a web app that performs large scale analytics on Waze data, as well as doing real-time streaming of this data for inspecting the current state of the Waze community.

More specifically, I gathered data from the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. via a very "unofficial" data collection method.  The resulting data was very messy, so I had to heavily clean and preprocess this data and then performed analytics on a number of metrics that seemed interesting (and as mentioned, also used this real-time data stream to create a Waze community map of the current user reported events).

Here is the pipeline I used:
