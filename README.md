# anywaze

**Anywaze** is a project I created while at Insight Data Science, while participating in the Data Engineering track of the program.  It is a web app that does large scale analytics on Waze data, as well as rendering Waze data in realtime.  More specifically, I gathered data from the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. via a very "unofficial" data collection method, heavily cleaned and preprocessed this data and then provided analytics on a number of metrics (and as mentioned, also basically created a Waze desktop clone using their real-time data).
