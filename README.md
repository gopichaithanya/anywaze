# anywaze

**Anywaze** is a project I created while at [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com), while participating in the [Data Engineering](http://insightdataengineering.com) track of the program.  It's a web app that does large scale analytics on Waze data, as well as real-time streaming of Waze data to inspect the current state of the Waze community.

More specifically, I gathered data from the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. via a very "unofficial" data collection method.  The resulting data was very messy, so heavily cleaned and preprocessed this data and then provided analytics on a number of metrics I found interesting (and as mentioned, also created a Waze desktop clone using their real-time data stream).

Here is the pipeline I used:
